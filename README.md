Trying out the 100 Days of Code Python to master python

Here, I'll update my progress with regard to learning python.
I'll mention the stuff I make in this readme file. 
Links to individual python projects will be specifically linked to.

Going to be interesting I hope...

Day 1: Band Name Generator - here, I take user input and print it on the screen. I learn also how to find length of strings and how to switch variables.

Day 2: Tip Calculator - where the user can input the total cost of the bill and the percent of tip along with how many are to split the bill and calculate the amount each has to pay. I also learn how to create a bmi calculator and also to find out how much time is left for a person upon entering their age.

Day 3: Learned conditionals in python and created a treasure hunt kinda game -- very simple.

Day 4: Created Rock paper scissors console game. Tried it my own way and later found out a better alternate way. Will keep this lesson in mind.

Day 5: Created a password generator which takes in user input wrt the number of letters, numbers and symbols needed ad generate a random password.

Day 6: There were no python files for this day as all the code was written in Reeborg's world website which is a really interesting website for learning. The maze challenge was a tough one but I did manage to do it on my own. The added difficult level however I was not able to crack. But it's alright.
